  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the DibbleDabble beta app, platform, services, and website (collectively, the "Service").
    By signing up for our beta or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Beta Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The DibbleDabble platform is currently in beta. Features and functionality may evolve as we continue to build and refine the Service.
    Any updates will be implemented in accordance with industry standards for health and fitness applications, including compliance with 
    HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for data structure and exchange, and best practices for data security, provenance, 
    backups, and interoperability. While the platform is still under development, we are committed to maintaining a reliable, secure, 
    and standards-based environment for your fitness and health data.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to misuse the Service. This includes (but is not limited to) attempting to gain unauthorized access, disrupting service performance,
    or submitting false, misleading, or inappropriate data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content and branding on the Service (excluding your own health or fitness data) remains the property of DibbleDabble.
    You may not copy, reuse, or distribute this content without express written permission.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our discretion, particularly in cases of abuse, misuse, or violation of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated from time to time. If significant changes occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you via email or within the app.
    Continued use of the Service after changes are posted indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.
